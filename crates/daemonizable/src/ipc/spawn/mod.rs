//! Fork+exec daemon spawn and the pieces of the parent↔daemon startup
//! protocol.
//!
//! The moving parts are split by responsibility:
//! - [`mod@process`] — the fork+exec machinery on the parent side
//!   ([`spawn_daemon_process`], plus the `testutils`-gated
//!   `start_background_process_with_exe`) and the build-id handshake
//!   validation that completes a spawn.
//! - [`mod@handshake`] — the build-id handshake both sides exchange
//!   ([`send_handshake`] on the daemon side, validation on the parent side).
//! - [`mod@inherited`] — the daemon child's one-time claim of the pipe fds it
//!   inherited across `execve` ([`rpc_server_from_inherited_fds`]).
//!
//! The fd numbers and stage-sentinel argv tokens shared across those modules
//! live here.

/// needs scrubbing before the daemon spawns children of its own, which is
/// what lets this crate avoid `env::remove_var` (and its no-concurrent-
/// env-readers contract) entirely. Second, with no environment marker to
/// filter out, stage 1 can re-exec with the inherited environment untouched
/// (`execv`), so the daemon's environment is byte-identical to the
/// foreground's and stage 1 never has to walk `environ` — which would race a
/// C-level `setenv` from any constructor-spawned thread.
///
/// The names are namespaced/ugly on purpose. Dispatch in [`crate::run`]
/// checks argv[1] against them before any app code runs, so an application
/// *flag* can never collide; these are, however, reserved tokens — a process
/// whose first argument is exactly one of them (hand-invocation, or argument
/// passthrough of hostile data) is routed to the corresponding daemon stage,
/// where the fd validation rejects anything the framework didn't plumb (see
/// the stage functions in `app::daemon_child` for what a hand-run observes).

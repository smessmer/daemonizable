# daemonizable

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

The `daemonizable` library turns a single command-line binary into both a
foreground program *and* the background daemon it launches — and keeps a
typed, two-way channel open between the two.

You write an ordinary CLI. At some point it decides to go into the
background: it calls one method, and the library launches a fresh copy of
your *same* binary as a detached daemon, hands you back a channel for
talking to it, and — the part that most daemonizing tools get wrong — waits
to learn whether that daemon actually came up before your foreground
process continues. If the daemon fails to start, your CLI gets a real error
and can exit non-zero, instead of reporting success for a daemon that died
on startup.

To use it, implement one trait — [`Daemonizable`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizable/trait.Daemonizable.html) — on your app type. You
provide the request and response types the two sides exchange, a `build_id`
string, a foreground entry point (this is your real `main`), and a daemon
entry point. [`run`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/run/fn.run.html) looks at how the process was started and calls the
right one for you. The library is deliberately policy-free: it does the
process plumbing and nothing else. It imposes no argument parser, no logging
framework, no panic hook, and no startup banner on your application.

The channel between the two processes carries your own
[`Daemonizable::Request`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizable/trait.Daemonizable.html#associatedtype.Request) / [`Daemonizable::Response`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizable/trait.Daemonizable.html#associatedtype.Response) values, serialized
and framed for you. (An internal handshake also rides the same channel to
confirm both processes are the same build, but that happens before any of
your types are touched and is invisible to your code.)

## Example

`src/main.rs` — the attribute generates `main`, so this is the whole file:

```rust
use std::process::ExitCode;

use daemonizable::{Daemonizable, Daemonizer, RpcServer};

struct MyApp;

#[daemonizable::main]
impl Daemonizable for MyApp {
    type Request = String;
    type Response = String;

    fn build_id() -> String {
        format!("my-app {}", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
    }

    fn run_foreground(daemonizer: Daemonizer<Self>) -> ExitCode {
        // This is your `main`: parse arguments however you like, then
        // daemonize whenever (and only if) you decide to.
        let mut rpc = daemonizer.spawn_daemon().unwrap();
        rpc.send_request(&"hello".to_string()).unwrap();
        println!("daemon says: {}", rpc.recv_response_blocking().unwrap());
        ExitCode::SUCCESS
    }

    fn run_daemon(mut rpc: RpcServer<String, String>) -> ! {
        // Runs in the re-exec'd daemon child. Serve requests until the
        // parent drops its client (EOF), then exit.
        while let Ok(request) = rpc.next_request() {
            rpc.send_response(&format!("echo: {request}")).unwrap();
        }
        std::process::exit(0)
    }
}
```

`#[daemonizable::main]` comes from the default-on `macros` feature. It leaves
the impl untouched and appends
`fn main() -> ExitCode { daemonizable::run::<MyApp>() }` — the entire `main`
an application on this library should have. Build with
`default-features = false` and the attribute is gone; write that one line
yourself, and keep `main` to exactly that one line: the re-exec'd daemon
child runs the same `main`, so anything in front of [`run`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/run/fn.run.html) runs in the
daemon too (a thread spawned there exists in the child as well). The
attribute guarantees an empty preamble by construction. (The example above
is shown, not compiled; the compiled equivalent is the doctest on [`run`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/run/fn.run.html),
and the
macro's expansion is covered by the trybuild snapshots in
`daemonizable-e2e-tests/tests/macro_ui/`.)

## Why use this library?

- **You find out whether the daemon started.**
  [`Daemonizer::spawn_daemon`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizer/struct.Daemonizer.html#method.spawn_daemon) blocks until the daemon is confirmed up. A
  daemon that fails to launch surfaces as a typed error in the parent, not
  a silent success — this is the single biggest thing the traditional Unix
  daemonization dance gets wrong (spelled out below).
- **A live channel, not a fire-and-forget fork.** The parent keeps talking
  to the daemon over a typed request/response channel: send it configuration
  as a first request, wait until it reports *its* notion of "ready" before
  exiting, and so on. If the daemon dies, the next call returns an error
  rather than hanging forever.
- **One binary, no version skew.** The daemon is a relaunch of the exact
  same executable, so there is no separate `myapp-daemon` binary to build,
  ship, and accidentally mismatch against the CLI that spawned it.
- **Safe to daemonize from an async program.** Because the daemon starts as
  a fresh process rather than a frozen copy of yours, you can spawn it with
  a tokio runtime or thread pool already running — something a plain
  `fork()` cannot do safely.
- **Clean daemon by default.** The daemon runs in its own session, detached
  from any controlling terminal, with its working directory at `/` and no
  accidentally-inherited file descriptors; call [`detach_stdio`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/ipc/fn.detach_stdio.html) to let go
  of the terminal's stdio once you are ready. Nothing else is installed that
  you did not ask for.
- **A one-line `main`.** `#[daemonizable::main]` writes the whole `main` for
  you; there is no boilerplate to get subtly wrong.

## When to reach for something else

This library is a good fit for daemons a *user* launches from a shell —
mount helpers, agents, and the like. It is not always the right tool:

- **A service manager already supervises your process.** If systemd,
  launchd, or a container runtime runs you, don't self-daemonize at all: run
  in the foreground and report readiness the way the manager expects (e.g.
  `sd_notify`). Self-backgrounding actively gets in such a manager's way.
- **You want fire-and-forget backgrounding with batteries included.** Crates
  such as `daemonize` and `fork` ship pid-file locking, privilege dropping,
  `chroot`, and `umask` control that this library does not have yet. If you
  don't need to know whether the daemon came up, and you can guarantee no
  thread has started before you fork, one of those can be a smaller choice.
- **Your `main` can't cooperate.** Relaunching the binary needs your
  executable to be the entry point (a wrapper script breaks it) and, on
  Linux, needs `/proc` mounted.

The sections below make the case in full: why relaunching the binary
(fork+exec) beats a plain fork, why the readiness handshake matters, how the
specific alternative crates compare, and what this approach costs.

## Why fork+exec? A comparison with the alternatives

Every other option in this space — the classic double-fork ritual, the
`daemon(3)` libc call, and the crates.io daemonizers (`daemonize`,
`daemon`, `daemonize-me`, `daemonize-simple`, `fork`,
`nix::unistd::daemon`) — shares two structural decisions that this library
deliberately rejects:

1. they daemonize by **fork *without* exec**, so the daemon lives out its
   entire life inside a copied snapshot of the parent's process image, and
2. they **cut the cord at fork time** — the parent exits (almost always
   with status 0) before the daemon has run a single line of real
   initialization, so daemon startup failures are invisible to whoever
   launched it.

Both are real, documented problems, not stylistic gripes. (What this library
keeps from the classic ritual is the *second* fork — it performs
`daemon(7)`'s second fork itself, but *after* `exec`, in the fresh
single-threaded child, where it is unconditionally safe. What it rejects is
fork-without-exec and cord-cutting, not the second fork.)

### fork without exec: the daemon inherits a broken process image

`fork()` in a threaded process hands the child a frozen snapshot: every
other thread vanishes mid-step, but everything those threads were holding
— mutexes, allocator arenas, channel internals — is copied into the child
in its locked state, forever.
[POSIX is explicit](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fork.html)
about this: the child contains "a replica of the calling thread and its
entire address space, possibly including the states of mutexes and other
resources", and consequently "may only execute async-signal-safe
operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called."
Rust's own [`CommandExt::pre_exec`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html#tymethod.pre_exec)
docs describe that post-fork world as "a very constrained environment
where normal operations like malloc, accessing environment variables
through `std::env` or acquiring a mutex are not guaranteed to work".

The rest of the ecosystem agrees. Tokio doesn't support `fork()` while a
runtime is running
([tokio#4301](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/4301), closed by
runtime documentation merged in
[tokio#8202](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/8202)). Go's standard
library has never offered a bare fork (only fork+exec via
`syscall.ForkExec` / `os/exec`). CPython 3.12+ raises a
`DeprecationWarning` from
[`os.fork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fork) when it
detects threads, because "it has never been safe to mix threading with
`os.fork()` on POSIX platforms".

A fork-only daemonizer therefore bets your daemon's life on *nothing* in
the process having started a thread yet — not your code, not a lazy
static, not an allocator or telemetry background thread in any dependency
— and keeps paying that bet for the daemon's entire lifetime, because the
daemon *is* the forked image. The fork-based crates leave this assumption
implicit.

fork+exec is the escape hatch POSIX itself names: the async-signal-safe
restriction applies only *until the exec*.
[`execve(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html)
resets the process image — all other threads are gone by construction
("mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads objects are not
preserved"), caught signal dispositions revert to their defaults, the
memory image and allocator state are rebuilt from scratch, and only file
descriptors deliberately left inheritable survive. The re-exec'd daemon
can start tokio, spawn threads, and generally behave like the freshly
started process it actually is. State it needs from the parent arrives
explicitly — as a typed request on the RPC channel — instead of implicitly
through a memory snapshot.

(The symmetric honesty: the *parent* can already have a tokio runtime
running when it calls `spawn_daemon` — fork+exec makes that safe. On the
platforms with `pipe2(O_CLOEXEC)` there is no residual constraint at all;
only on macOS/iOS, which lack it, does a narrow spawn-time race remain while
the pipe fds get their CLOEXEC flag set non-atomically — and even there it
covers a moment at spawn time, not the daemon's whole life.)

### cutting the cord at fork time: nobody hears the daemon fail

The canonical description of SysV daemonization —
[`daemon(7)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/daemon.7.html)'s
15-step ritual — makes readiness reporting *mandatory*: the daemon must
"notify the original process started that initialization is complete"
via "an unnamed pipe or similar communication channel" (step 14), and the
invoker "must be able to rely on" the original process exiting only
"after initialization is complete and all external communication channels
are established" (step 15). Those are exactly the steps everyone skips:

- **`daemon(3)`** provides no channel at all: by the time it returns, the
  parent has already `_exit(0)`'d.
- **The `daemonize` crate** has the parent exit the instant the second
  fork succeeds. Pid-file locking (the "already running" check!), stdio
  redirection, privilege drop, and your entire daemon body all run *after*
  the CLI has already reported success, and their errors go to `/dev/null`
  by default. It's worse than that: `start()` passes the raw `waitpid`
  status (not `WEXITSTATUS`) to `exit()`, so even a first-child failure
  with code N becomes wait status `N << 8`, which truncates to exit
  code 0 — success. The fix
  ([PR #53](https://github.com/knsd/daemonize/pull/53)) has been open
  since May 2023.
- **An init system can't reconstruct readiness from the outside**:
  [`systemd.service(5)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.service.5.html)
  says of `Type=forking` — the mode built for exactly these daemons —
  "The use of this type is discouraged, use notify, notify-reload, or
  dbus instead."

The pipe handshake that `daemon(7)` demands is what serious daemons end up
hand-rolling, because fork-based self-daemonization — the classic Unix
pattern — otherwise loses every startup error. `sshd` backgrounds itself
with the libc [`daemon(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/daemon.3.html)
call, but only *after* it has bound its listen sockets, so "address already
in use" still reaches your terminal
([`sshd.c`](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/sshd.c);
`-D` skips the backgrounding entirely). nginx does the same bind-before-fork,
and its [`ngx_daemon()`](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/master/src/os/unix/ngx_daemon.c)
deliberately leaves stderr attached — it `dup2`s stdin/stdout to `/dev/null`
but the stderr redirect sits under `#if 0` — so config errors still print;
[`daemon off;`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/faq/daemon_master_process_off.html)
drops backgrounding entirely for a supervisor or container. PostgreSQL
splits the roles: the `postgres` server never daemonizes, and the
[`pg_ctl`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-ctl.html) wrapper
backgrounds it and then polls `postmaster.pid` until it reads "ready to
accept connections" before returning (the `-w` wait is the default since
PostgreSQL 10) — the same readiness handshake through a status file instead
of a pipe. Even [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/httpd.html)
only detaches (`fork` + `setsid`) once its config is parsed, and ships
`-DNO_DETACH` / `-DFOREGROUND` to suppress each half for a supervisor. And
libfuse — this library's home turf, it was extracted from
[CryFS](https://www.cryfs.org) — grew a whole new API for it
([`fuse_daemonize_early_start` / `_success` / `_fail`](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse))
so the mounting parent stays alive until the mount actually succeeded and
can report failure otherwise. The modern answer is to skip self-daemonization
altogether: under systemd the recommended shape is a foreground process
reporting readiness via [`sd_notify(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_notify.html),
with the self-backgrounding
[`Type=forking`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.service.5.html)
discouraged (see the last entry in the costs list below).

daemonizable builds that handshake in as the core primitive instead of an
afterthought. [`Daemonizer::spawn_daemon`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizer/struct.Daemonizer.html#method.spawn_daemon) blocks through the build-id handshake; a child
that fails it is killed, reaped, and surfaced as a typed error — your CLI
prints a real message and exits non-zero. And
it doesn't stop at "started": the RPC channel stays open, so the parent
can wait for whatever *its* definition of ready is before exiting (CryFS
exits 0 only after the daemon reports the filesystem is actually mounted).
If the daemon dies instead of answering, the parent gets an EOF error
rather than a hang. The inherited pipe fds are re-marked close-on-exec as
soon as the daemon claims them, so subprocesses the daemon spawns don't
inherit the RPC pipe ends and can't hold that EOF open past the daemon's
own exit.

### The crates, specifically

A point-in-time snapshot (July 2026) — versions and maintenance status
will drift, check crates.io for where things stand now:

| crate | mechanics | CLI sees daemon startup errors? | parent↔daemon channel | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `daemonize` 0.5.0 | double fork, no exec | no — parent exits 0 first, plus the raw-`waitpid` bug above | none (parent never even learns the daemon's pid) | last release 2023-02; GitHub issue tracker disabled; exit-code and soundness fixes unmerged since 2023/2024 |
| `daemon` 0.0.8 | none — despite the name it never forks or calls `setsid`; it's a signal-to-channel run loop + Windows service shim | n/a | n/a | last release 2018-09 |
| `daemonize-me` 2.0.2 | single fork + `setsid` | no | none | 2.0.2 (2025-03) came after a 3-year gap |
| `daemonize-simple` 0.1.6 | double fork | no | none | maintained; all errors are bare `&'static str` |
| `fork` 0.8.0 | double fork | no | none | actively maintained; note that 0.1.x–0.3.x closed fds 0–2 outright (fd-reuse hazard) and returned the intermediate session leader to the caller — fixed across 0.4.0–0.6.0 (Nov–Dec 2025) |
| `nix::unistd::daemon` / `libc::daemon` | `daemon(3)`: single fork | no | none | `nix`'s wrapper isn't even compiled on Apple targets; Apple has deprecated `daemon()` since macOS 10.5 ("Use posix_spawn APIs instead") |

On `daemon(3)` itself: it's a 4.4BSD invention that is in no standard
([`STANDARDS: None`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/daemon.3.html)),
its own BUGS section admits it skips the double fork ("the resulting
daemon is a session leader"), and Apple deprecated it two decades ago.

To be fair to the fork-based crates: several carry battle-tested SysV
batteries this library doesn't have yet — locked pid files, setuid/
setgid privilege drop, chroot, umask control (planned as opt-in options;
see the TODO in the costs list below). If you need
fire-and-forget backgrounding with those knobs, and you can guarantee the
fork happens before any thread exists, `fork` (the crate) is a reasonable
minimal choice. What none of them can do is tell you whether your daemon
actually came up.

### Why not a second binary?

The other conventional design is to ship a separate `myapp-daemon`
executable and `Command::spawn` it (the dockerd / ssh-agent shape). That
costs you two artifacts to build, package and install, a lookup problem
(absolute path? `$PATH`? relative to `argv[0]`?), and — worst — a version
skew problem: nothing stops CLI 1.4 from spawning a daemon 1.3 whose wire
format differs silently.

Re-exec'ing the current binary makes skew structurally impossible on
Linux: [`/proc/self/exe`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc_pid_exe.5.html)
is a kernel magic link to the running image's inode, so the daemon is
byte-identical to the parent even if the on-disk binary was replaced by a
package upgrade mid-run, and the build-id handshake catches whatever the
platform can't guarantee (the macOS `current_exe()` fallback, operator
mistakes). This is well-trodden ground: Docker/Moby ships a dedicated
[`reexec` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moby/sys/reexec) whose
`Self()` returns the literal string `/proc/self/exe` ("safe to delete or
replace the on-disk binary"); [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
re-execs itself as `runc init` with a bootstrap pipe fd passed through an
environment variable — env-marker plus inherited-fd, the same shape used
here; and `systemctl daemon-reexec` re-execs PID 1 itself.

### What this approach costs

An honest comparison cuts both ways. The price of fork+exec plus a typed
channel:

- **The binary must cooperate.** [`run`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/run/fn.run.html)`::<App>()` has to be the whole of
  `main` — `#[daemonizable::main]` guarantees that by construction, but the
  binary being re-exec'd must still be *your* binary, so a wrapper-script
  entry point breaks re-exec. Fork-based crates work on any code with zero
  cooperation.
- **procfs.** On Linux the re-exec needs `/proc` mounted (bare chroots and
  minimal containers may not have it); other platforms fall back to
  `current_exe()` plus the handshake.
  *TODO: degrade gracefully instead of failing — when `/proc/self/exe`
  is unavailable, fall back to `getauxval(AT_EXECFN)` / `argv[0]`
  resolution (`current_exe()` is not a fallback on Linux; it reads
  `/proc/self/exe` itself). The fallback gives up the same-inode
  guarantee, but the build-id handshake already turns a swapped binary
  into a clean error rather than a wrong daemon.*
- **At most a narrow spawn-time race on macOS.** Because the daemon is
  created with fork+exec, a running tokio runtime (or any thread pool) is
  fine to spawn under — the parent-side restriction is *not* "no tokio." On
  Linux/Android, the *BSDs, and every other target with `pipe2(O_CLOEXEC)`,
  the pipe fds are created with `FD_CLOEXEC` already set, so there is no
  race at all. macOS/iOS have no `pipe2` (nor any atomic equivalent), so
  there the flag is set a moment after creation and a concurrent fork on
  another thread in that window can leak the fds; those targets keep the
  spawn-at-startup invariant.
  *TODO: migrating from `command-fds`' `pre_exec` to std's planned fd
  mappings ([rust#145687](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/145687))
  would drop the last bit of non-atomic fd handling in the spawn path.*
- **No batteries (yet).** Pid files, privilege drop, chroot, umask,
  signal-mask reset, and log-file stdio redirection are currently the
  application's job.
  *TODO (planned): add these as opt-in options, applied in the daemon
  child before entering [`Daemonizable::run_daemon`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizable/trait.Daemonizable.html#tymethod.run_daemon) — carried by a framework-owned
  bootstrap frame reintroduced with the batteries (config-in, result-out),
  distinct from the removed app-facing payload — so that every
  failure — an "already running" pid-file lock conflict, a failed
  `setuid`, an unwritable log path — surfaces as a typed error in the
  parent and a non-zero CLI exit. That is exactly what the fork-based
  crates structurally cannot offer: they perform these same steps after
  their parent already exited 0, with errors going to `/dev/null`. The
  planned set, following `daemon(7)` and the `daemonize` feature list:
  an `flock`-locked pid file written with the final daemon pid (the
  kernel drops the lock on process death, so stale pid files are
  harmless; the lock can even be taken in the parent before spawning —
  `flock` belongs to the open file description, which the daemon inherits
  across the exec and the second fork — so "already running" fails before a
  child is ever spawned), `initgroups`/`setgid`/`setuid` privilege drop,
  optional `chroot`, explicit `umask` (currently silently inherited — it
  survives `execve`), signal-mask reset (the mask, unlike handlers, also
  survives `execve`), fd hygiene for non-CLOEXEC fds inherited from the
  CLI's own environment (`close_range(5, ~0)` on Linux, sparing the pipe
  fds 3/4), and `detach_stdio` gaining redirect-to-log-file targets (log
  files opened before the privilege drop, so root-owned log directories
  work). Defaults stay policy-free: every battery is opt-in.*
- **Initialization runs twice.** The daemon re-runs the dynamic loader and
  everything before `run` (with `#[daemonizable::main]`, that's nothing);
  parent state must be shipped explicitly via the typed RPC channel.
- **If systemd manages your process, don't daemonize at all.**
  `daemon(7)`'s "new-style daemons" doctrine is that services should run
  in the foreground and report readiness via `sd_notify(3)`; SysV-style
  self-daemonization "interfere\[s\] with process monitoring, file
  descriptor passing, and other functionality of the service manager".
  That applies to this library too. daemonizable is for processes a *user*
  launches — mount helpers, agents started from a shell — which is exactly
  the niche it was extracted from.

That's the design in one sentence: fork+exec buys the daemon a clean
process image, and the typed channel turns daemonization from a leap of
faith into an operation that can fail loudly.

## Process contract

- The daemon is a **grandchild**: the re-exec'd child forks a second time
  after `setsid` (the classic double fork, `daemon(7)` step 7). The
  session-leader intermediate exits immediately and is reaped by
  [`Daemonizer::spawn_daemon`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizer/struct.Daemonizer.html#method.spawn_daemon) itself, and the surviving daemon — never a session leader,
  so it can never acquire a controlling terminal — is orphaned to init (or
  the nearest `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER` ancestor, e.g. a systemd user
  manager) at spawn time. A **successful** spawn leaves the caller no child
  and no zombie, regardless of the caller's own lifetime.
- A **failed** spawn (handshake mismatch or spawn failure) is killed via its
  process group (`kill(-child_pid, SIGKILL)`, which reaches the grandchild;
  ESRCH falls back to a direct kill for a child that died before `setsid`)
  and the intermediate reaped before the error is returned. A grandchild the
  group signal misses (it left the group via its own `setsid`/`setpgid`)
  still self-terminates via pipe EOF within ~10 s once the client is dropped
  — so failed-spawn teardown of the daemon is asynchronous, not synchronous
  with the returned error.
- Two caveats on [`Daemonizer::spawn_daemon`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizer/struct.Daemonizer.html#method.spawn_daemon) itself: it can block
  indefinitely if the intermediate is externally SIGSTOPped/ptraced in the
  instant before it exits, since it is reaped with a blocking `wait()` (the
  build-id handshake recv is timeout-bounded, so a wedged child during the
  handshake is not); and the caller must not concurrently reap arbitrary
  children (e.g. a `SIGCHLD` handler that calls `waitpid(-1)`) during the
  spawn, which could reap the intermediate first and defeat the cleanup's
  pid bookkeeping.
- [`Daemonizer::spawn_daemon`](https://docs.rs/daemonizable/latest/daemonizable/app/daemonizer/struct.Daemonizer.html#method.spawn_daemon) is safe to call with a tokio runtime already running —
  fork+exec hands the daemon a fresh process image, so the fork-vs-threads
  hazard ([tokio#4301](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/4301))
  doesn't apply (the second fork runs in that fresh single-threaded image,
  before any app code, so it is safe too). On targets with `pipe2(O_CLOEXEC)`
  (Linux/Android, the *BSDs, …) the pipe fds are `FD_CLOEXEC` from creation,
  so there is no fd-inheritance race; only on macOS/iOS, which lack `pipe2`,
  does a narrow race remain if another thread forks while the spawn sets
  `FD_CLOEXEC` on its pipe fds, and spawning before the process starts other
  subprocesses avoids it there.

## Features

- `macros` *(default)*: re-exports `#[daemonizable::main]` from the
  `daemonizable-macros` companion crate — the recommended way to write your
  `main`. Disable it and you hand-write
  `fn main() -> ExitCode { daemonizable::run::<MyApp>() }` instead; nothing
  else about the API changes.
- `testutils`: test-only helpers (e.g.
  `RpcConnection::into_server_and_client`) so downstream crates can drive the
  IPC primitives in their own unit tests. Not part of the stable surface.

Unix-only (Linux is the primary target; macOS works with caveats documented
in the source).
